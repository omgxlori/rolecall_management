## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```md
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rolecall-manager.git
```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
```md
cd rolecall-manager
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```md
npm install inquirer pg
```

4. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the connection details in the code:

Open index.js (or index.ts if you're using TypeScript) and update the following:
```md
const pool = new pg.Pool({
  user: 'your_postgres_user',
  host: 'localhost',
  database: 'employees_db',
  password: 'your_postgres_password',
  port: 5432,
});
```

5. Run the database schema file to create the required tables in PostgreSQL:
```md
psql -U postgres -d employees_db -f schema.sql
```

6. Populate the database with seed data (optional):
```md
psql -U postgres -d employees_db -f seeds.sql
```

## Usage

1. Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

If you're using TypeScript, first compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript:
```md
npx tsc index.ts
```

2. Start the application:

After compiling, start the application by running the generated index.js file:
```md
node index.js
```

3. You will be greeted with an ASCII art title of "RoleCall Manager" and presented with a menu of options to interact with the system:
```md
  _____       _       _____      _ _
 |  __ \     | |     / ____|    | | |
 | |__) |___ | | ___| |     __ _| | |

## Technologies
- Node.js: The runtime environment used to execute JavaScript code.
- PostgreSQL: The relational database used to store and manage employee, role, and department data.
- Inquirer.js: The package used to create an interactive command-line interface.
- pg (node-postgres): A PostgreSQL client for Node.js to interact with the database.

## Database Schema
The PostgreSQL database for this project consists of three tables:

**Department:**

- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- name (VARCHAR(30), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)

**Role:**
- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- title (VARCHAR(30), UNIQUE, NOT NULL)
- salary (DECIMAL, NOT NULL)
- department_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Department.id, NOT NULL)

**Employee:**
- id (SERIAL PRIMARY KEY)
- first_name (VARCHAR(30), NOT NULL)
- last_name (VARCHAR(30), NOT NULL)
- role_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Role.id, NOT NULL)
- manager_id (INTEGER, FOREIGN KEY to Employee.id, NULLABLE)


## Future Improvements

Some possible enhancements to the RoleCall Manager application include:
- Ability to track employee performance or attendance.
- Adding more detailed employee information such as contact details.
- Improved UI/UX with a graphical interface or web-based front-end.
